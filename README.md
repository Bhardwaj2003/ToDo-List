# ToDo-List
React To do app :)
Frontend: Responsive design with a user-friendly interface.
Backend: Node.js API for persistent data storage in a JSON file.

Functionalities:
->Add a task.
->Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
->Delete tasks.
->Show a message when no tasks are available.
->Filter tasks.

Manual Testing

Frontend:
-Verify the ability to add a to-do item.
-Check that tasks can be marked as complete/incomplete.
-Ensure deleted tasks are removed from the list.
-Test "All," "Active," and "Completed" filters for accuracy.
-Validate responsiveness across various screen sizes.

Backend:
-Test all endpoints using Postman or CURL.
-Verify that tasks persist after server restarts.
-Check for proper error handling (e.g., invalid id).

2. Integration Testing
-Use the frontend to interact with the backend and ensure data flows correctly.
-Verify that changes in the UI correspond to updates in the todos.json file.
